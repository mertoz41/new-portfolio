                  I am Mert Ã–zkaynak, a Washington DC based creative developer with experience building RESTful APIs and reusable user interfaces for web and mobile apps.

              Technology was not my first career path although I encountered computers at a young age playing video games. 
              In high school I took graphic design courses and learned how to photoshop myself into 2k covers and draw logos on Illustrator. 
              In college I was making house and hip-hop beats on Fruity Loops Studio, while I took video editing courses and learned Adobe Premiere.
              While I enjoyed being a creative with these tools, I never considered them for more than hobbies.

              Once basketball career came to an end, I saw programming as the next step and attended the Flatiron Bootcamp to learn full-stack web development with Ruby on Rails and React.
              While I enjoy building both sides of apps and handling their integrations, I found a love for frontend development for the creative joy it brings to design the user experience.

              When I am not coding I am coaching hoops, hooping myself, and browsing Beatport for music to mix.
