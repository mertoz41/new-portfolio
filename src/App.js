          <h2>story</h2>
          <p>Born and raised in Izmir, Turkey, I came to the US in 2010, seeking to continue my education as a student-athlete. 
            Upon graduating from T.C. Williams High School in 2014 and Thiel College in 2018 with a bachelors degree in International Business studies, I played professional basketball for a year with Sigortam Net ITU Basket in Istanbul. 
            In 2020, I pursued my passion for technology by attending a software engineering bootcamp at Flatiron School to learn full-stack web development. 
            So far it has been a smooth transition as I channel the discipline and work ethic gained from basketball into this nonstop evolving industry. 
            I spend most of my time working on projects, studying computer science fundamentals, and incorporating new technologies in quest to mastery.</p>
